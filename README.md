# About Mootor

The key features are:

* Fast performance
* Easy to use
* Fully customizable, strongly considering design issues

## Examples

See inside the "examples" folder, **you will need a web server (or UIWebView)** if you want to load views. 

If you want to run the examples in a desktop browser, **you will need to emulate touch events**, for example using the "Emulate touch events" in Chrome Developer Tools.
